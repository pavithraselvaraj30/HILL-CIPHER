IMPLEMENTATION OF HILL CIPHER
 
## To write a C program to implement the hill cipher substitution techniques.

## DESCRIPTION:

Each letter is represented by a number modulo 26. Often the simple scheme A = 0, B
= 1... Z = 25, is used, but this is not an essential feature of the cipher. To encrypt a message, each block of n letters is  multiplied by an invertible n × n matrix, against modulus 26. To
decrypt the message, each block is multiplied by the inverse of the m trix used for
 
encryption. The matrix used
 
for encryption is the cipher key, and it sho
 
ld be chosen
 
randomly from the set of invertible n × n matrices (modulo 26).


## ALGORITHM:

STEP-1: Read the plain text and key from the user. STEP-2: Split the plain text into groups of length three. STEP-3: Arrange the keyword in a 3*3 matrix.
STEP-4: Multiply the two matrices to obtain the cipher text of length three.
STEP-5: Combine all these groups to get the complete cipher text.

## PROGRAM 
```
 #include <stdio.h> 
 
int main()  
{ 
    unsigned int key[3][3] = {{6, 24, 1}, {13, 16, 10}, {20, 17, 15}}; 
    unsigned int inverseKey[3][3] = {{8, 5, 10}, {21, 8, 21}, {21, 12, 8}}; 
 
    char msg[4]; 
    unsigned int enc[3] = {0}, dec[3] = {0}; 
 
    printf("Enter plain text: "); 
    scanf("%3s", msg); 
 
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) 
            enc[i] += key[i][j] * (msg[j] - 'A') % 26; 
 
    printf("Encrypted Cipher Text: %c%c%c\n", enc[0] % 26 + 'A', enc[1] % 26 + 'A', enc[2] % 26 + 
'A'); 
 
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) 
dec[i] += inverseKey[i][j] * enc[j] 
dec[i] += inverseKey[i][j] * enc[j] % 26; 
printf("Decrypted Cipher Text: %c%c%c\n", dec[0] % 26 + 'A', dec[1] % 26 + 'A', dec[2] % 26 + 
printf("Decrypted Cipher Text: %c%c%c
 'A'); 
return 0; 
} 
```
